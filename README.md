# COMP3340 Group Project - Group 5

## Introduction
This is the repo of the COMP3340 group project (group 5) in HKU (2023-2024 sem2). It is about exploring different models and methods to solve a rocket landing problem in Lunar Lander environment from OpenAi's Gym library - [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/), [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).


## Source Code
In our implementation, the versions of the environment and the packages used may vary with teammates. Thus, we seperate the codes in four folders with name format ``[Method]-[Teammate's name]``, and include the README file in each folder. 

You may start from creating a new conda environment for each folder.

Be careful about the work directory and file path when you run the code!

## Demo
In ``./Demo`` folder, there are the demo gifs and videos we generated for each method.
